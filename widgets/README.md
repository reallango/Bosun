# Widget packages

Each folder here is one package that Bosun can offer under **Settings → Widgets** (Available).
Bosun reads this folder from the branch chosen there (`main` by default, or `dev`).

A package folder is named after its package id and contains:

- `manifest.json` (required), see `_template/manifest.json`
- optional text files (JSON, Markdown, ...) next to it, up to two folders deep

Rules the manifest is checked against (a package that fails is listed as "skipped"):

- `schema` is `1`; `id` is 2-40 characters of `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, starts with a letter, and equals the folder name.
- `version` is `major.minor.patch` (for example `0.0.1`). A higher version shows as an upgrade.
- `widgets` lists 1-10 widget types. Their fields are the ones on the Custom Widgets page
  (`display_name`, `description`, `icon`, `category`, `default_size`, `min_size`, `refresh_interval`,
  `supports_linux`, `supports_windows`, `config_schema`). An optional `spec` object holds the declarative
  definition interpreted by the widget runtime.
- `permissions` lists the permissions the package adds. Ids must start with `<package id>.`, and a package may
  not imply a built-in high-risk permission.
- A package cannot use the id or widget type of a System widget (the widgets built in to Bosun).
- Folders starting with `_` are ignored (templates).

A package can also be exported from Settings → Widgets as a zip and imported on another Bosun
(`manifest.json` at the top of the zip, or inside one folder).
